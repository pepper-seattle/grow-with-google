			<p><em>Hedgehogs have fiercesome spines which are really just to protect the helpless little dude or dudette beneath.</em></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Scientific Name</span>: Erinaceinae</li>
				<li><span>Average Length</span>: 7.9-12 inches</li>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 2-5 years</li>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: Hedgerows, woodlands, and meadows</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Known for their brightly tipped spines and tiny stature, the hedgehog is a particularly adored creature of the wildlands. Though their lifespan is short that does not stop tiny humans from wanting them as pets for Christmas nor their dimwitted parents from buying them in such a capacity.</p>
